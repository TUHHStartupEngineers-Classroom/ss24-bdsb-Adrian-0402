This is a template example for lab journaling. Students in the data science courses at the Institute of Entrepreneurship will use this template to learn R for business analytics. Students can replace this text as they wish.

## How to use

1. Accept the assignment and get your own github repo.

2. Blog/journal what you are doing in R, by editing the `.qmd` files. 

3. See the links page for lots of helpful links on learning R.

4. Change everything to make it your own.

5. Make sure to render you website everytime before you want to upload changes

```{r}
#| eval: true
numbers <- 1:1000

# This will print the first 10 elements of the vector numbers
numbers[1:10]

# This will plot a histogram of 100 random elements of the vector numbers
hist(sample(numbers, 100, replace = T))
```
